# Grabenah

## Usage

```shell
# output csv to current directory
$ grabenah ./path/to/grab-screenshot.jpeg

# output csv to specific directory
$ grabenah ./path/to/grab-screenshot.jpeg ~/Documents/Family/Expenses.csv
```

## Idea

The main idea here is that I screenshot the activities page in my grab app, and then send it over to my laptop to have
it encoded to a spreadsheet for budget tracking purposes.

- Should read the image
- Extract the price and dates
- Output to CSV
